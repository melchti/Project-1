Unit 11 Submission File: Network Security Homework
Part 1: Review Questions
Security Control Types
The concept of defense in depth can be broken down into three different security control types. Identify the security control type of each set of defense tactics.
1. Walls, bollards, fences, guard dogs, cameras, and lighting are what type of security control?
Answer: Physical Security
2. Security awareness programs, BYOD policies, and ethical hiring practices are what type of security control?
Answer: Management security
3. Encryption, biometric fingerprint readers, firewalls, endpoint security, and intrusion detection systems are what type of security control?
Answer: Operational Security
Intrusion Detection and Attack indicators
1. What's the difference between an IDS and an IPS?
Answer: An IDS is a stateless, passive network management tool that logs and notifies specified individuals about network traffic. An IPS is an active, stateful control system that is capable of initializing security protocols such as blocking traffic from a specified port.
2. What's the difference between an Indicator of Attack and an Indicator of Compromise?
Answer: The IOA can indicate attacks happening in real time, can tell if an attack is currently happening but a full breach isn’t determined yet and focuses on the intent of the attacker
The IOC can indicate an attack has occurred resulting in a breach, exposes vulnerabilities in an attack allowing the defense ample time to increase defense and can indicated previous malicious activity. 
The Cyber Kill Chain
Name each of the seven stages for the Cyber Kill chain and provide a brief example of each.
1. Stage 1: Reconnaissance: The attacker chooses a target and does research on the targets vulnerabilities so the attacker can expose them.
2. Stage 2: Weaponization: The attacker creates a weapon to infiltrate the target such as a virus to exploit the vulnerabilities of the target. This can result in a zero-day attack if they only target one vulnerability or it can result in multiple attacks against multiple vulnerabilities.
3. Stage 3: Delivery: In this step the attacker delivers the malicious materials to the target through means such as an email with an attachment.
4. Stage 4: Exploitation: In this step the malicious means from stage 3 are promoted and triggered to exploit the targets vulnerabilities(s).
5. Stage 5: Installation: The malware inserts an access point such as a back door so the attacker can fully access the targets network.
6. Stage 6: Command and Control: The backdoor gives the attacker full access to the network.
7. Stage 7: Actions on objective: The attacker has gained full access to the network and now can fulfill their objective weather it’s to receive money, data or anything else.
Snort Rule Analysis
Use the Snort rule to answer the following questions:
Snort Rule #1
alert tcp $EXTERNAL_NET any -> $HOME_NET 5800:5820 (msg:"ET SCAN Potential VNC Scan 5800-5820"; flags:S,12; threshold: type both, track by_src, count 5, seconds 60; reference:url,doc.emergingthreats.net/2002910; classtype:attempted-recon; sid:2002910; rev:5; metadata:created_at 2010_07_30, updated_at 2010_07_30;)
1. Break down the Sort Rule header and explain what is happening.

Answer:  alert tcp $EXTERNAL_NET 4444 -> $HOME_NET any 4444 (msg: “inbound on 4444”)


Part 2: "Drop Zone" Lab
Log into the Azure firewalld machine
Log in using the following credentials:
* Username: sysadmin 
* Password: cybersecurity 
Uninstall ufw 
Before getting started, you should verify that you do not have any instances of ufw running. This will avoid conflicts with your firewalld service. This also ensures that firewalld will be your default firewall.
* Run the command that removes any running instance of ufw.
[Sudo ufw reset]
Sudo apt -y remove ufw
Enable and start firewalld 
By default, these service should be running. If not, then run the following commands:
* Run the commands that enable and start firewalld upon boots and reboots.
* $ <sudo systemctl enable firewalld > or < sudo /etc/init.d/firewalld start>
$ <sudo systemctl start firewalld >
Note: This will ensure that firewalld remains active after each reboot.
Confirm that the service is running.
* Run the command that checks whether or not the firewalld service is up and running.
$ <sudo systemctl status firewalld >
List all firewall rules currently configured.
Next, lists all currently configured firewall rules. This will give you a good idea of what's currently configured and save you time in the long run by not doing double work.
* Run the command that lists all currently configured firewall rules:
$ <sudo firewall-cmd --list-all >
* Take note of what Zones and settings are configured. You many need to remove unneeded services and settings.
List all supported service types that can be enabled.
* Run the command that lists all currently supported services to see if the service you need is available
$ <sudo firewall-cmd -–get-services >
* We can see that the Home and Drop Zones are created by default.
Zone Views
* Run the command that lists all currently configured zones.
$ <sudo firewall-cmd -–list-all-zones >
* We can see that the Public and Drop Zones are created by default. Therefore, we will need to create Zones for Web, Sales, and Mail.
Create Zones for Web, Sales and Mail.
* Run the commands that creates Web, Sales and Mail zones.
* $ <sudo firewall-cmd -– permanent -–new-zone=web >
* $ < sudo firewall-cmd -– permanent -–new-zone=sales >
$ < sudo firewall-cmd -– permanent -–new-zone=mail >
Set the zones to their designated interfaces:
* Run the commands that sets your eth interfaces to your zones.
$ <sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --change-interface=eth0>
$ <sudo firewall-cmd --zone=web --change-interface=eth1>
$ <sudo firewall-cmd --zone=sales --change-interface=eth2>
$ <sudo firewall-cmd --zone=mail --change-interface=eth3>


* Add services to the active zones:
* Run the commands that add services to the public zone, the web zone, the sales zone, and the mail zone.
* Public:
* $ <sudo firewall-cmd -–zone=public -–add-service=http>
* $ <sudo firewall-cmd -–zone=public -–add-service=https >
* $ <sudo firewall-cmd -–zone=public -–add-service=pop3 >
$ <sudo firewall-cmd -–zone=public -–add-service=smtp >
* Web:
$ <sudo firewall-cmd -–zone=web -–add-service=http >
* Sales
$ <sudo firewall-cmd -–zone=sales -–add-service=https >
* Mail
* $ <sudo firewall-cmd -–zone=mail -–add-service=smtp >
$ <sudo firewall-cmd -–zone=mail -–add-service=pop3 >
* What is the status of http, https, smtp and pop3?
Add your adversaries to the Drop Zone.
* Run the command that will add all current and any future blacklisted IPs to the Drop Zone. 
* $ <sudo firewall-cmd -–zone=drop -–add-source=10.208.56.23 >
* $ <sudo firewall-cmd -–zone=drop -–add-source=135.95.103.76 >
$ <sudo firewall-cmd –zone=drop -–add-source=76.34.169.118 >
Make rules permanent then reload them:
It's good practice to ensure that your firewalld installation remains nailed up and retains its services across reboots. This ensure that the network remains secured after unplanned outages such as power failures.
* Run the command that reloads the firewalld configurations and writes it to memory
$ <sudo firewall-cmd--reload >
View active Zones
Now, we'll want to provide truncated listings of all currently active zones. This a good time to verify your zone settings.
* Run the command that displays all zone services.
$ < sudo firewall-cmd -–list-all-zones >
Block an IP address
* Use a rich-rule that blocks the IP address 138.138.0.3.
$ <sudo firewall-cmd -–permanent -–add-rich-rule=”rule family=’ipv4’ source address=’138.138.0.3’ reject” >
Block Ping/ICMP Requests
Harden your network against ping scans by blocking icmp ehco replies.
* Run the command that blocks pings and icmp requests in your public zone.
$ <audo firewall-cmd -–zone=public -–add-icmp-block=echo-reply >
Rule Check
Now that you've set up your brand new firewalld installation, it's time to verify that all of the settings have taken effect.
* Run the command that lists all of the rule settings. Do one command at a time for each zone.
* $ <sudo firewall-cmd -–zone=public -–list-all >
* $ <sudo firewall-cmd -–zone=sales -–list-all >
* $ <sudo firewall-cmd -–zone=web -–list-all >
* $ <sudo firewall-cmd -–zone=mail -–list-all >
$ <sudo firewall-cmd -–zone=drop -–list-all >
* Are all of our rules in place? If not, then go back and make the necessary modifications before checking again.
Congratulations! You have successfully configured and deployed a fully comprehensive firewalld installation.

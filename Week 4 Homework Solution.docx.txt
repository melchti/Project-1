Week 4 Homework Submission File: Linux Systems Administration
Step 1: Ensure/Double Check Permissions on Sensitive Files
1. Permissions on /etc/shadow should allow only root read and write access.
   * Command to inspect permissions: ls -l /etc/shadow
   * Command to set permissions (if needed): sudo chmod 600 /etc/shadow
2. Permissions on /etc/gshadow should allow only root read and write access.
   * Command to inspect permissions: ls-l /etc/gshadow
   * Command to set permissions (if needed): sudo chmod 600 /etc/gshadow
3. Permissions on /etc/group should allow root read and write access, and allow everyone else read access only.
   * Command to inspect permissions: ls -l /etc/group
   * Command to set permissions (if needed): sudo chmod 644 /etc/group
4. Permissions on /etc/passwd should allow root read and write access, and allow everyone else read access only.
   * Command to inspect permissions: ls -l /etc/passwd
   * Command to set permissions (if needed): sudo chmod 644 /etc/passwd
Step 2: Create User Accounts
1. Add user accounts for sam, joe, amy, sara, and admin.
   * Command to add each user account (include all five users): sudo adduser sam
   * Sudo adduser joe
   * Sudo adduser amy
   * Sudo adduser sara
   * Sudo adduser admin
   * (bash only lets me add two users at a time or it displays an error stating this)
2. Ensure that only the admin has general sudo access.
   * Command to add admin to the sudo group: sudo usermod -G sudo admin
Step 3: Create User Group and Collaborative Folder
1. Add an engineers group to the system.
   * Command to add group: sudo groupadd –system engineers
2. Add users sam, joe, amy, and sara to the managed group.
   * Command to add users to engineers group (include all four users): sudo adduser sam engineers
   * sudo adduser joe engineers
   * sudo adduser amy engineers
   * sudo adduser sam engineers
3. Create a shared folder for this group at /home/engineers.
   * Command to create the shared folder: sudo mkdir /home/engineers
4. Change ownership on the new engineers' shared folder to the engineers group.
   * Command to change ownership of engineer's shared folder to engineer group: sudo chown :engineers /home/engineers/
Step 4: Lynis Auditing
1. Command to install Lynis: sudo wget https://downloads.cisofy.com/lynis/lynis-2.7.3.tar.gz
2. Command to see documentation and instructions: 
man lynis
sudo lynis--help


3. Command to run an audit: sudo lynis audit system
4. Provide a report from the Lynis output on what can be done to harden the system.
   * Screenshot of report output: All snapshots included with file uploaded just posting Lynis security scan details in here (31 screenshots total, too many to fit in this page)
  

  

Bonus
1. Command to install chkrootkit: sudo apt install chkrootkit -y
2. Command to see documentation and instructions: sudo --help chkrootkit
3. Command to run expert mode: sudo chkrootkit -x
4. Provide a report from the chrootkit output on what can be done to harden the system.
